# Purpose

A quick set of exercises for Thinkful Flex. Module 10 Lesson 5, this app will allow users to choose 1-50 and have that number of pictures of dogs displayed.
Users will also be able to request an image of a dog breed if that breed is available. The goal of the exercise is to serve as an introduction to fetch API and interfacing with some rudimentary APIs.

# Challenges

Fetch doesn't catch 404's or any other errors in the range 400-600. So it's important to catch these using a .then() to check if the result is ok (see three.js in function handleSubmit).
